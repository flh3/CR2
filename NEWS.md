# CR2 0.2.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added col/row names to the robust variance/covariance matrix
* Adjusted the "meat" matrix so computations would still run even if only the intercept is used as a predictor (a null model)
* Added tidy methods so CR2 objects can be used with other packages such as modelsummary or gtsummary
* As of 2023.01.03
